      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a Computer Science and Engineering student with a passion for problem-solving and building the future through technology. My expertise spans across several domains, including web development, ethical hacking, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. I’m always exploring new technologies, whether it's mastering a new programming language or diving into the latest frameworks. I’m well-versed in a variety of programming languages such as Java, Python, C, C++, and JavaScript. I’m also skilled with HTML, CSS, SQL, and frameworks like React.js, Django, and Bootstrap. As someone with a deep interest in ethical hacking and AI, I constantly push my boundaries, experimenting with security threats and creating solutions to make the digital world safer. <br /> Throughout my academic journey, I’ve participated in numerous hackathons and idea competitions, which have sharpened my problem-solving skills and helped me collaborate with like-minded individuals. <br /> I’ve also had the privilege of interning with industry giants like Microsoft and working with innovative companies like SDSR Consultancy and Swarnabha Industries, where I contributed to web development projects and learned from industry professionals. When it comes to development, my goal is always to create intuitive, efficient, and impactful technology. I'm driven by the belief that technology has the power to solve real-world problems, and I love working on projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible. <br /> In my journey, I strive to stay curious and always look for new ways to improve. My approach is simple: experiment, learn, and build. If you’re interested in collaborating or discussing technology, feel free to connect!
